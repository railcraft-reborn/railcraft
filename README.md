## What is Railcraft Reborn?

Railcraft Reborn is a community driven continuation of the popular Minecraft mod [Railcraft](https://github.com/Railcraft/Railcraft), originally devloped by **CovertJaguar**. It is built 
on top of the [NeoForged](https://github.com/neoforged) API.

The mod greatly expands and improves the minecart system in Minecraft - adding many new blocks, entities,
and features.
