## What is Railcraft?

Railcraft is a mod written for the hit game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It is built on top
of the [NeoForged](https://github.com/neoforged) API.

It greatly expands and improves the Minecart system in Minecraft. Adding many new blocks, entities,
and features. It has been in development since 2012 and contains over 800 class files and hundreds
of thousands of lines of code.
The mod was created by the user going by the name **CovertJaguar**.

- **CovertJaguar** is currently in charge of development for Minecraft 1.12 in
  this [repo](https://github.com/Railcraft/Railcraft).
- This repo is maintained by **Sm0keySa1m0n** and [**Edivad99**](https://github.com/Edivad99) and
  aims to develop for the most recent versions of Minecraft.
