/**
 * The heart of the Charge system is here.
 *
 * <p>
 * Any block that wants to interact with the Charge network should implement {@link ChargeBlock} and
 * ensure that they call the proper add/remove functions.
 *
 * <p>
 * Everything else is done through {@link Access}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example code: {@code Charge.distribution.network(world).access(pos).useCharge(500.0)}
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * General Charge Network Overview: The Charge Network is unique in that component blocks aren't
 * required to have a {@link net.minecraft.world.level.block.EntityBlock}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This means the vast majority of the network is made up of dumb static blocks resulting in very
 * low cpu overheard. This remains true even for very large grids. The network of grids is
 * maintained as a separate data structure outside the world. Each grid, which is defined as a
 * collection of connected charge blocks, only ticks its battery objects. Only blocks which store or
 * provide Charge to the grid need battery blocks; wires, tracks and consumers do not. This means
 * that only a small percentage of the grid is using cpu resources, while the bulk exists passively
 * simply as means to define connectivity.
 *
 * <p>
 * One side effect of this is that the Charge API cannot use the Forge's Capability API. That only
 * works on Tile Entities, not blocks. So don't bother asking for one, it won't happen.
 *
 * <p>
 * The grid is constructed lazily as things access it. It will slowly expand from there at a rate of
 * a few hundred blocks per tick per network. Grids form and grow and merge, a relatively cheap
 * operation, as they encounter other grids. However, any time a block is removed from the grid, the
 * entire grid is destroyed and must reform. So removal is the more expensive operation, avoid it if
 * possible. It is not recommended for blocks to remove themselves from the network for any reason
 * other than destruction. Block removal from the network could disrupt the grid its connected too
 * for several ticks, this may only be noticeable on grids of over several thousand blocks.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every block on the grid has a generic loss over time. It various with the type of block, more
 * details on that in the {link {@link mods.railcraft.api.charge.ChargeBlock.Spec}}. The value is
 * calculated as the grid is constructed and removed from the grid every tick. Consider it
 * representative of resistive losses and current leakage. All large scale real life power systems
 * suffer from these loss effects and are often major concerns when designing these systems.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a consumer asks to remove Charge from the grid, it goes to the list of batteries and tries
 * to remove from each in turn. The batteries are sorted based on their {@link ChargeStorage.State}.
 * The order batteries are drawn from is as such: source->rechargeable->disposable. Additionally,
 * they are further sorted based on efficiency. Each battery has an efficiency value associated with
 * it. This efficiency value defines how expensive it is to extract charge from the battery.
 * Generators have perfect efficiency and are more efficient than batteries which are more efficient
 * than transformers. To get a more efficient grid, add more generators or high efficiency
 * batteries.
 *
 * <p>
 * Charge is added to the grid by grabbing a source battery and adding Charge to the battery
 * directly. Generally a block that provides a source battery will use a Tile Entity to handle
 * creating and adding Charge to its own battery. From there the grid handles distribution.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is achieved by leveling the Charge in all the rechargeable batteries in the grid every tick.
 * The benefit of this is that even if the grid is split apart for any reason, charge will be evenly
 * distributed to the component parts. Batteries store their charge levels in their own NBT file
 * alongside the world, this allows them to not rely on Tile Entities for serialization.
 *
 * <p>
 * This brings us to another side effect of maintaining grids and batteries outside the world. The
 * grid will continue to operation unhindered even if large parts of it exist in chunks that are
 * currently not loaded. At the moment, to get this benefit the entire grid needs to be loaded at
 * least once per restart, though not all at the same time. Research is being done on how difficult
 * it would be to persist nodes as well as batteries. But that is an enhancement for the future.
 *
 * <p>
 * The unit of measurement used for Charge is now based on Forge Energy. This means, ignoring
 * efficiency losses, that 1 Charge equals 1 FE/RF. This allows for simple conversion between the
 * two systems. However, as a simplification, Railcraft's Charge lacks a concept of voltage. There
 * are however plans for separate transmission and distribution networks, which would result in
 * similar needs for transformers to convert from one to the other. You will see traces of these new
 * features scattered throughout this API. The framework is in place, it just lacks the blocks
 * themselves to make it work.
 *
 * <p>
 * As of 2021, Charge changed from 1 Charge unit to 1 IC2 EU to 1 Charge unit to 1 FE/RF
